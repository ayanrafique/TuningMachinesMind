            "title": "Transfer Learning for Pneumonia",
            "content": "Transfer learning was stated by Andrew Ng in his NIPS 2016 tutorial to be a key driver in the success of industrial applications. It can be shown that even in the handling of medical imaging data, that transfer learning can greatly reduce the costs of training over a dataset compared to the costs of training the same model from scratch. We will load up a simple usage given by Jeremy Howard of fast.ai, of the resnet-50 architecture, trained over the imagenet dataset. This model therefore has a, if you will, a sense of what the material world looks like. The pneumonia dataset we will be using is the kaggle dataset paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. . data.show_batch(rows=3, figsize=(7,6)) . . This dataset is a collection of thousands of labeled files of chest x-rays. . learn = cnn_learner(data, models.resnet50, metrics=error_rate) learn.lr_find() learn.recorder.plot() . . Here we use a method that was originally published in the 2015 paper Cyclical Learning Rates for Training Neural Networks. By simply increasing the learning rate incrementally from a small value and only stopping once the loss started decreasing, you can plot the learning rates. By doing this, one can find the optimal learning rate amongst the plot. . learn.fit_one_cycle(8) . . Implementing a method of tuning weights for the network, cycling over our data 8 epochs times, we get an error rate of 0.036721, which means our model is over 96% accurate! Not bad! Note that this was done without unfreezing the model and actually applying the learning rate for minimal loss. The default learning rate of 0.003 of the fit_one_cycle method gives appreciable results for this use case, while maintaining a steady lowering of the error rate through each cycling of the data. . You can play around with this experimentation with the google colab file. You must download and upload your own kaggle.json file to use the code as is, which can be aquired after making a kaggle account. .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # Title &gt; Awesome summary - toc: true- branch: master- badges: true- comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . #collapse-hide import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . #collapse-show cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. . Example 1: DropDown . # single-value selection over [Major_Genre, MPAA_Rating] pairs # use specific hard-wired values as the initial selected values selection = alt.selection_single( name=&#39;Select&#39;, fields=[&#39;Major_Genre&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;], init={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: &#39;Drama&#39;, &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: &#39;R&#39;}, bind={&#39;Major_Genre&#39;: alt.binding_select(options=genres), &#39;MPAA_Rating&#39;: alt.binding_radio(options=mpaa)} ) # scatter plot, modify opacity based on selection alt.Chart(movies).mark_circle().add_selection( selection ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, tooltip=&#39;Title:N&#39;, opacity=alt.condition(selection, alt.value(0.75), alt.value(0.05)) ) . Example 2: Tooltips . alt.Chart(movies).mark_circle().add_selection( alt.selection_interval(bind=&#39;scales&#39;, encodings=[&#39;x&#39;]) ).encode( x=&#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;, y=alt.Y(&#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, axis=alt.Axis(minExtent=30)), # use min extent to stabilize axis title placement tooltip=[&#39;Title:N&#39;, &#39;Release_Date:N&#39;, &#39;IMDB_Rating:Q&#39;, &#39;Rotten_Tomatoes_Rating:Q&#39;] ).properties( width=600, height=400 ) .
